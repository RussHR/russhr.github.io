          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my humble web page.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôre probably interested in my work as a frontend web developer. To give you an idea of myself as a dev:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              My work philosophy is greatly informed by my time in San Francisco, particularly as a <strong>growth engineer at Slack.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              I view projects from a holistic perspective. <strong>I love improving existing or legacy systems,</strong> especially with regard to the developer or user experience. I also try to see how developer pain points tie into business costs or needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data is great.</strong> It‚Äôs important to use it to measure the success of an initiative or identify what to build next. I believe that giving developers insight into data can be very encouraging.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the <a href="https://www.agile-moose.com/debonos-6-hats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six thinking hats model</a>, <strong>I often wear the green hat.</strong> Otherwise, I usually swap off between the white, red, and yellow hats.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand that hiring a multinational team brings about its own challenges. It‚Äôs one thing to impose company values onto an internationally diverse team, but it‚Äôs another to understand that <strong>each person potentially brings a wildly different set of expectations</strong> to their working lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I highly value empathy and nonviolent communication</strong> despite ‚Äúempathy‚Äù being a buzzword. Years in the industry have shown me: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/computers-are-easy-people-are-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computers are easy, people are hard</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engendering diversity and inclusion is great (and the <strong>ethical</strong> thing to do), but it usually has to start at the upper levels of a company. It‚Äôs also obvious when a company touts D&I for face value. Despite this, there are small things everyone can do to make their work environment just a bit more welcoming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> if communication didn‚Äôt happen publicly, it didn‚Äôt happen. I also find tools for visual communication like Miro incredibly helpful.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tech leadership is a great skill that can be exercised by any developer at any level. There‚Äôs much <strong>more to being a great developer than just coding.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Burnout is a huge issue</strong> in this industry, especially for those <a href="https://techinformed.com/almost-half-of-women-in-tech-report-burnout-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underrepresented in tech</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              I don‚Äôt believe that all developers need to be pushed towards the next promotion. What I find <strong>more important is developing a culture of <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-psychological-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological safety</a></strong> and open feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Everyone makes mistakes,</strong> myself included. It‚Äôs important to have room for that. When something goes awry, it‚Äôs usually the process, not the person.
